# Movie-prediction-analysis

Predicting the success of upcoming movies is a challenging yet fascinating task that combines data science with the entertainment industry. By analyzing various factors such as budget, cast popularity, director track record, and movie genres, we can build models to estimate how well a movie might perform commercially, though it may not predict the twisted creative industry nature. This project compares several machine learning algorithms to classify movies into success categories based on their gross-to-budget ratio. The goal is to provide insights that could help producers, marketers, and investors make informed decisions. While the models show promising accuracy, predicting movie success remains complex due to many unpredictable factors.

A comparative study on how well the algorithms helped in extracting relevant features and balancing the score(0 to 3, 0-worst, 3-blockbuster) has been done, and that's the main goal here. Algorithms like Random Forest, logistic regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and Gradient Boosting are considered to conduct this study, while Gradient Boosting yields the best result.
